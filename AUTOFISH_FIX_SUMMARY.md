# AutoFish Fix Summary

## Problem
The AutoFish module was detecting fish bites correctly (the "!!!" indicator was being found), but it was **not reeling in the fish** automatically.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `onClientTick()` method's fish handling logic. While the detection code (`checkForFishBiteRender()`) was working and setting `fishHooked = true`, the reeling logic had problems:

1. After calling `useRod()` to reel in, the hook state wasn't being properly reset
2. The code didn't return early after handling the fish hooked state, causing conflicts with other logic in the same tick
3. The re-throw logic only worked when `cfgRethrow()` was enabled, which might not always be the case

## Changes Made
Modified the fish hooked handling section in `AutoFish.java` (around line 252-270):

### Key Fixes:
1. **Reset hook state after reeling**: Added `hookTick = -1` and `autoFishActive = false` when reeling in the fish
2. **Added early return**: After handling the fish hooked state, the method now returns early to prevent interference with other logic
3. **Fixed re-throw logic**: Only re-throws if `cfgRethrow()` is enabled, and properly exits after re-throwing
4. **Better state management**: The fish hooked state is now properly isolated from other fishing logic

### Code Changes:
```java
// Handle fish hooked state
if (fishHooked) {
    if (tickAfterHook == 0) {
        // Immediately reel in
        useRod();
        hookTick = -1; // Reset hook tick since we just reeled in
        autoFishActive = false; // Mark as inactive
        if (cfgMessage()) say("Auto Fish: Fish hooked! Reeling in...");
    }
    if (tickAfterHook == (int)cfgThrowCooldownTicks() && cfgRethrow()) {
        // Re-throw after delay (only if rethrow is enabled)
        useRod();
        autoFishActive = true;
        hookTick = 0;
        fishHooked = false;
        tickAfterHook = 0;
        if (cfgMessage()) say("Auto Fish: Re-thrown");
        return; // Exit early to prevent further processing this tick
    }
    tickAfterHook++;
    if (tickAfterHook > 40) {
        // Safety reset after 2 seconds
        fishHooked = false;
        tickAfterHook = 0;
    }
    return; // Don't process other logic while handling fish hooked state
}
```

## Testing
- Build completed successfully with no errors
- Only minor warnings (unused imports, deprecated API usage) which don't affect functionality

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. When a fish bites (bobber entity shows "!!!"), the mod detects it
2. Immediately reels in the fish on the same tick
3. If auto-rethrow is enabled, waits for the configured delay and throws again
4. Properly resets all state variables to avoid conflicts

## How to Test
1. Enable AutoFish in the mod configuration
2. Hold a fishing rod and cast it into water
3. Wait for a fish to bite (you'll see the "!!!" indicator on the bobber)
4. The mod should automatically reel in the fish
5. Check chat for the message: "Auto Fish: Fish hooked! Reeling in..."
